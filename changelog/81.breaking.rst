This removes the older verison of `sunkit_instruments.goes_xrs.calculate_temperature_em` that no longer works for the re-processed netcdf files and new GOES-R data.

This also removes the `sunkit_instruments.goes_xrs.calculate_radiative_loss_rate` and `sunkit_instruments.goes_xrs.calculate_xray_luminosity` functions that also no longer work in their current form.

The new `sunkit_instruments.goes_xrs.calculate_temperature_em` function now returns a new sunpy.timeseries.GenericTimeSeries with the temperature and emission measure rather than appending columns to the passed XRSTimeSeries.
